# Cash Register

This is a simple cash register application built with Ruby on Rails. It allows users to add products to a cart and compute the total price with special pricing rules. The application includes a web-based UI styled with Bootstrap and uses Importmap for managing JavaScript dependencies.

## Features

- Add products to a cart
- Remove products from a cart
- Compute the total price of items in the cart
- Special pricing rules:
  - Buy-one-get-one-free offer on Green Tea (GR1)
  - Bulk discount on Strawberries (SR1): If you buy 3 or more, the price drops to 4.50â‚¬ each
  - Discount on Coffee (CF1): If you buy 3 or more, the price drops to 2/3 of the original price

## Pricing Rules Implementation

The pricing rules are implemented in the `PricingRules` service object, which calculates the total price based on the items in the cart and applies the special pricing rules.
